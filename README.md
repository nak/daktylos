# daktylos
Daktylos can be used with sqlalchemy-supported databases, and comes with MySQL and Amazon Redshift support.  To use the SQL modules, there are separate requirements-sql.txt and requkirement-redshift.txt files to install dependencies.  Database creation is automatically handled when connecting to the database, if preferred.
